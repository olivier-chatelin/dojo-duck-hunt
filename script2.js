//  call the duck element 'duck'
//Make the duck move with the stepX or stepY increment
//When the duck moves, the duck element has only one class name
//.duck-down or .duck-right or .duck-up or duck-left among its direction




//prevent the duck from going out of the screen





//call the shoot function (already implemented)  when duck is shot





//Manage the Game Over Case by using bulletCount variable
